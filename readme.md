# Introduction

This fork of the Adafruit Circuit python library adds support for the Grow R503 fingerprint sensor.

## Dependencies

This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

## TODO

 - This library at the moment does not support checksum. Right now the checksum is ignored. Af future release should solve this issue.
 -  UPDATE see latest release ~~The R503 sensor has a circular light around the sensor, support for controlling the light is missing~~


## Usage Example


See 'examples' folder for full usage demo!



Documentation
